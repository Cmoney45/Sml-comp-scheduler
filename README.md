## Description

Small Company scheduler is a simple app that was designed for creating a quick an easy way a small company could schedule employees for their time. It has a simple login with different views for manager and employees. Managers can schedule employees on a week to week basis and employees can see their scheduled time to work.

## Technologies

We used MYSQL and Sequelize for the backend database and routing. We used Materialize for front-end framework. 

## Ideas for future development

We had several ideas for features that we were not able to add into the app:

* Create a fully fledged sign-in system
* Allow employees to submit time off
* Allow managers to approve time-off and not schedule them
* A chat room to allow employees to trade-shifts
* An option to send shift request changes between employees to a manager for approval
